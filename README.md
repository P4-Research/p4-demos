This repository is used by me to share research experiments based on P4. 

The current demos you can find here:

1. **IP routing** - this demo presents how to implement basic IP router using P4. The static routing entries for IP router are populated manually (from command line).
2. **MPLS** - this demo presents how to implement MPLS network using P4 (with static routing), BMv2 and Mininet.
3. **MPLS with PISCES** - demo presents how to implement MPLS protocol for P4-capable version of OVS called PISCES.
4. TBC

To prepare demos I have used Python, P4, BMv2 (or PISCES) and Mininet. The mn/ directory contains definition of P4Switch and P4Host for Mininet.
