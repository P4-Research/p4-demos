This repository is used by me to share research experiments based on P4. 

The current demos you can find here:

1. **IP routing** - this demo presents how to implement basic IP router using P4. The static routing entries for IP router are populated manually (from command line).
2. TBC

To prepare demos I have used Python, P4, BMv2 and Mininet. The mn/ directory contains definition of P4Switch and P4Host for Mininet.
